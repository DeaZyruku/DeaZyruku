Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Dea, a PhD candidate at the University of Potsdam in Germanay. My project aims to identify the potential of future land use change in the Vjosa river region, to the bird biodiversity and analyze the spatial distribution of functional syndromes of aquatic macroinvertebrates along the ecosystem. We quantify the influence of land use outside of the riverine ecosystem on bird communities within the riverine ecosystem using spatiotemporal models. Based on this data, we calculate community attributes, including taxonomic diversity metrics, community mean trait values, and functional diversity metrics. We model their distribution using predictors describing gradients of climate, riverine habitat types and dynamics, and landscape structure in the neighborhood of the transects. This approach combines the strengths of remote sensing and detailed bird observations, offering a holistic understanding of the factors shaping avian ecology along the Vjosa River in Albania.

I am currently mastering my R skills.
